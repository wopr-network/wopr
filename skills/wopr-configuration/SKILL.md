# WOPR Configuration

Use this skill to read and update WOPR configuration keys, including plugin-specific config stored under `plugins.data`.

## Quick workflow

1. Read current config or a specific key.
2. Update config values as needed.
3. Reset or list config keys when troubleshooting.

## Progressive disclosure

- For CLI commands and usage, read `references/cli.md`.
- For daemon API endpoints, read `references/api.md`.
- For the config schema and supported top-level keys, read `references/schema.md`.
