# Brand Voice (WOPR)

Goal: sound like a *person with taste*, not a corporate product page.

## Core rules
- Write like a human. Short sentences.
- No "We're excited to announce...".
- No hashtags. No emojis.
- Avoid "comprehensive", "platform", "solution".
- Prefer punchy one-liners over paragraphs.
- If a line works as a screenshot, it's good.

## Vocabulary
Use:
- "WOPR Bot" (a thing you own)
- "ship", "build", "deploy", "run"
- "$5" as the punchline (not in every sentence)

Avoid:
- "AI-powered", "leveraging", "synergy", "enterprise-grade"
- "end-to-end", "best-in-class"

## Tone
- Confident, a little ruthless.
- More "this changes your life" than "this has features".
- Mystery beats explanation early on.

## Twitter/X style
- One idea per tweet.
- 5–12 words is often enough.
- No threads that start with "1/".
- Don’t over-explain in replies.

### Examples (good)
- "3 weeks."
- "2 weeks. wopr.bot"
- "1 week. $5. No joke."
- "Your WOPR Bot doesn’t sleep. Invoice: $5."
- "OpenClaw helps you build a chatbot. Your WOPR Bot builds you a company."

### Examples (bad)
- "We're excited to announce the launch of our AI-powered automation platform..."
- "#AI #automation #startup"

## GitHub voice
- README: practical, minimal, no marketing fluff.
- Issues: direct, actionable, clear "done" criteria.
- PRs: explain *why* in 1–3 bullets.

## Discord voice
- Light moderation.
- Encourage showcasing builds.
- Let users flex.
